There isn't a single "best" trading strategy, as effectiveness depends on factors like market conditions, asset type (e.g., stocks, forex, crypto), risk tolerance, and backtesting results. However, for automation and simplicity, strategies based on technical indicators are ideal because they can be easily coded or set up in platforms like Python (with libraries such as TA-Lib or Backtrader), MetaTrader, or no-code tools like TradingView or Build Alpha. These aim for consistent rules without emotional decisions.

Scalping, which you mentioned, involves high-frequency trades for tiny profits (often in seconds or minutes) and requires low-latency setups, making it reliable in volatile markets but complex to automate due to slippage and fees. Here are some alternative simple strategies that are beginner-friendly, automatable, and focused on small regular gains or longer holds. I'll outline each with basic rules, pros/cons, and implementation tips.

### 1. Moving Average Crossover (Trend Following)
This identifies trends by comparing short-term and long-term moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages).
- **Basic Rules**: Buy when the short MA crosses above the long MA (bullish signal); sell when it crosses below (bearish). Add a stop-loss at 1-2% below entry.
- **Timeframe**: Daily or hourly charts for swing trading.
- **Pros**: Easy to code; captures big trends with minimal trades.
- **Cons**: Whipsaws in sideways markets; lags behind reversals.
- **Automation Tip**: Use Python to fetch data via yfinance, compute MAs with pandas, and execute via APIs like Alpaca or Interactive Brokers. Backtest on historical data to optimize periods.

### 2. Mean Reversion with RSI
Assumes prices revert to their average after extremes, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillator.
- **Basic Rules**: Buy when RSI (14-period) drops below 30 (oversold); sell when above 70 (overbought). Filter with volume or a moving average for confirmation.
- **Timeframe**: Intraday or daily for mean-reverting assets like forex pairs.
- **Pros**: Works in range-bound markets; simple threshold-based logic.
- **Cons**: Fails in strong trends; overtrading risk.
- **Automation Tip**: Implement in Excel for prototyping or code in Python with talib for RSI calculations. Platforms like QuantConnect offer free backtesting.

### 3. Momentum Trading
Buys assets showing upward strength, often using rate-of-change or MACD indicators.
- **Basic Rules**: Buy if price closes higher than 10 days ago (or MACD line crosses signal line upward); sell on the opposite. Target 1-5% profit per trade.
- **Timeframe**: Daily for stocks/indices like Nasdaq.
- **Pros**: Capitalizes on trends; straightforward comparisons.
- **Cons**: Vulnerable to reversals; needs strict risk management.
- **Automation Tip**: Code a loop to check historical closes; use no-code builders like Tradetron for quick setup without programming.

### 4. Breakout Strategy
Trades when price breaks key levels, like recent highs/lows.
- **Basic Rules**: Buy on breakout above resistance (e.g., 20-day high) with volume increase; sell below support. Use a trailing stop.
- **Timeframe**: Intraday or swing.
- **Pros**: High reward in volatile breakouts; automates well with alerts.
- **Cons**: False breakouts common; requires volatility filters.
- **Automation Tip**: Scan for levels using scripts in Thinkorswim or Python; integrate with brokers for auto-execution.

| Strategy | Complexity (1-5) | Typical Hold Time | Best For | Risk Level |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| Moving Average Crossover | 2 | Days to weeks | Trending markets (e.g., stocks) | Medium |
| Mean Reversion with RSI | 3 | Hours to days | Range-bound (e.g., forex) | Medium-High |
| Momentum Trading | 2 | Days | Momentum assets (e.g., tech indices) | Medium |
| Breakout | 3 | Hours to days | Volatile breakouts (e.g., crypto) | High |

Start by backtesting any strategy on historical data (e.g., via free tools like Backtrader) to simulate performanceâ€”remember, no strategy guarantees profits, and markets can change. Use paper trading accounts first, and always incorporate risk rules like position sizing (1-2% of capital per trade) to avoid large losses. If you're new to coding, no-code platforms can get you started quickly. Consult a financial advisor, as trading involves substantial risk of loss.
