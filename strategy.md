Building an Automated Breakout Trading Bot with Enclave Markets
Overview
Automating a breakout trading strategy on Enclave Markets (a platform for trading crypto perpetuals) involves combining real-time market data with programmatic trade execution. The goal is to buy when price breaks above resistance and sell (or short) when price breaks below support, confirmed by high trading volume and volatility. In this guide, we’ll outline how to use Enclave’s API (and possibly additional data sources) to build and tune such a trading bot, discuss whether Enclave’s API alone suffices for data, and consider the choice of TypeScript vs. Python for implementation. We’ll also touch on how multiple price feeds could give you an edge and how to gradually refine your strategy for different markets and conditions.
Enclave API Capabilities and Data Access
Enclave Markets provides a robust API for both market data and trade execution, which you can access via REST calls or WebSockets. According to Enclave’s documentation, anything you can do on the web platform can be done via API, and they even offer an official Python SDK for convenience
pypi.org
. For example, using the Python client, you can connect to the exchange and place orders in just a few lines of code:
from enclave.client import Client
import enclave.models
client = Client("<API_KEY>", "<API_SECRET>", enclave.models.PROD)
print(client.wait_until_ready())  # True when connection is ready

# Place a limit buy order on BTC-USD perpetual:
buy_order = client.perps.add_order(
    "BTC-USD.P",
    enclave.models.BUY,
    Decimal(42000),   # price 
    Decimal(0.1),     # quantity 
    order_type=enclave.models.LIMIT
)
The above snippet (from the Enclave Python SDK) shows how straightforward placing an order can be
pypi.org
. Enclave supports standard order types like market and limit orders, as well as attaching take-profit/stop-loss orders to positions
enclave.market
. For real-time data, Enclave’s API likely provides a WebSocket feed for live price updates, order book changes, and trades – common features for modern exchanges. You’ll want to use WebSockets for low-latency data to detect breakouts as they happen. Enclave’s platform touts real-time encrypted data feeds
finbold.com
, so your bot can subscribe to price streams. If a WebSocket API is available, use it to stream tick-by-tick prices or best bid/ask quotes. If not, you might resort to polling REST endpoints (though that’s less real-time and not ideal for a breakout strategy). Is Enclave’s API alone enough for data? Enclave will provide you data for its own markets (e.g., the BTC-USD perpetual contract’s price and volume on Enclave itself). For executing trades on Enclave, that’s the primary data you need. However, since Enclave is a relatively new exchange, you might not have extensive historical data or broad market context from it alone. The API likely gives you current order book, recent trades, etc., but if you need historical price series (e.g., to calculate a 20-day high or other technical indicators), you might need to gather that yourself over time or fetch it from an external source. Enclave’s mark price for perps is based on prices from multiple spot exchanges
enclave.market
, ensuring the contract tracks the global market. This means Enclave’s price should be in line with the broader market, but the API may not directly provide those external prices. In practice, you can derive the key levels (like 20-day highs) by recording Enclave’s price over days, or by importing historical data from another exchange for initialization. In short, Enclave’s API gives you the execution capabilities and real-time feed of its own market. For many strategies that could be sufficient. But for a highly responsive breakout system, you might supplement with other data feeds to improve your signal quality or speed, as discussed next.
Using Multiple Price Feeds for an Edge
You mentioned that “some [feeds] may react before others” – this is a savvy observation. In fast-moving markets, different exchanges might show a big price move a fraction of a second earlier than others. By monitoring multiple feeds, a trader can act on the first hint of a breakout on one venue before it’s reflected everywhere. This concept is essentially a mild form of latency arbitrage, where traders exploit the time lag between a price change on one exchange and its reflection on another
pocketoption.com
. For example, if Bitcoin spikes upward on Exchange A, there may be a brief moment before Exchange B’s price catches up; a bot watching Exchange A can buy on B before B’s price rises. In practice, here’s how you can leverage this:
Subscribe to a major exchange’s feed (like Binance or Coinbase) for the same asset (e.g., BTC-USDT or BTC-USD). These exchanges often have the highest volume and might lead price discovery. If Binance breaks a key resistance level with a surge in volume, that’s a strong signal that a breakout is underway globally. Your Enclave bot could use this as a trigger to buy the Enclave perpetual slightly earlier or with more confidence. Traders with faster data can act on price movements before slower participants, buying or selling assets milliseconds (or seconds) ahead of the broader market reaction
pocketoption.com
.
Confirming with multiple sources: You could also require that several major venues show the breakout, to avoid acting on a single-exchange glitch. For instance, if Binance and Coinbase both trade above your resistance price, it’s likely a genuine breakout and not an isolated order.
Technical implementation: Using multiple feeds means your bot will have to handle asynchronous data streams from different APIs. If you’re using Python, you might use threads or async IO to listen to e.g. Binance WebSocket data in parallel with Enclave’s data. In Node/TypeScript, you can spawn multiple websocket clients easily (Node’s event-driven nature is well-suited for handling multiple streams concurrently). Make sure to synchronize the data in time – you’ll be looking at timestamps or sequence numbers. You also want low latency; avoid polling external APIs if possible – use their streaming endpoints.
Caution on speed: The advantage from this approach can be very short-lived. Professional arbitrage bots and market makers are also watching those feeds in real time. They will swiftly arbitrage price differences, often in sub-second timeframes. To really capitalize on latency differences, you’d need a very fast connection (some firms even colocate servers near exchange servers for microsecond advantages
pocketoption.com
). As a small developer, you won’t beat the fastest players, but you might catch slightly delayed reactions on a smaller exchange. Given Enclave is an encrypted exchange focusing on fairness (no front-running, etc.), major public price moves should reflect there quickly, but if Enclave has fewer traders, you could see a brief lag that your bot can exploit. Just keep in mind this isn’t a guaranteed profit tactic – it’s an enhancement to improve your breakout signal timing.
In summary, multiple price feeds can be useful in two ways: (1) Speed – getting early warning of a breakout from a feed that leads the market, and (2) Confirmation – ensuring that the breakout is broad-based, not a false move on one platform. Implementing this will make your system more complex, but it could increase your strategy’s reliability. As long as you carefully manage the increased complexity (and latency isn’t too high on your end), this approach can help “automatically detect opportunities” across markets. In fact, many sophisticated strategies monitor several venues for exactly this reason – to capture moves that others miss or to be the first mover when momentum strikes

Choosing a Tech Stack: Python vs. TypeScript for Trading Bots
Your preference is TypeScript, but you’ve noticed a Python client is available for Enclave. This is a common dilemma in algo-trading development, and each choice has pros and cons:
Python Advantages: Python is extremely popular in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. It’s considered the go-to language for strategy research and prototyping due to its simple syntax and vast ecosystem of libraries
bigbrainmoney.com
. For example:
You have libraries for technical analysis (TA-Lib, pandas_ta), machine learning (if you later want to incorporate ML), data manipulation (Pandas for handling time series), and even complete frameworks for backtesting and live trading (Backtrader, Zipline, etc.).
The learning curve is gentle, and many examples and community projects exist (so you can often find snippets or get help for specific tasks).
Python’s ecosystem makes tasks like scanning for breakouts or calculating indicators very quick to implement – often just a few lines with Pandas or NumPy.
Enclave’s official Python SDK (available on PyPI) will save you time in interacting with the API, handling authentication, etc., out-of-the-box
pypi.org
. There are even Colab notebooks and example scripts provided, which is great for getting started fast.
Downside: Python can be slower at runtime than Node (especially for CPU-bound tasks) and is single-threaded by default (due to the GIL). However, for a trading bot that mainly waits for I/O (network data) and does light calculations, Python’s speed is usually sufficient. If you were doing ultra-HFT with millions of ticks per second, then C++ or similar would be considered – but that’s beyond our scope.
TypeScript/Node.js Advantages: JavaScript (and Node.js) has become surprisingly capable for trading bots too, especially with Node’s ability to handle asynchronous events efficiently. Some points in favor:
Unified stack: If you’re already a JS/TS developer, you can use one language for both the trading logic and any UI or web dashboard you might build. Node can be used for the backend bot, and you could have a web frontend (perhaps even using the same codebase/shared types if you plan carefully) to visualize your trades or performance.
Speed: Node.js is quite fast for I/O-bound tasks and can handle multiple websockets and API calls concurrently with ease. It’s also generally faster than pure Python for single-threaded computation due to V8 optimizations, though the difference for most trading logic is minor.
Growing ecosystem: While Python’s finance libraries are more mature, JS/TS has some libraries for technical analysis and crypto trading (for example, technicalindicators package for TA, or various exchange API wrappers). And of course, web frameworks if you are making a UI.
Downside: JavaScript/TypeScript has fewer off-the-shelf tools for trading. Many times you’ll find yourself implementing things that are one-liners in Python. For instance, Python has Pandas for time-series; in Node you might need to manually manage arrays of price data or use a less-common library. The JS ecosystem “lacks the deep library ecosystem found in languages like Python”, so you’ll spend more time building out analytics features from scratch
bigbrainmoney.com
. Also, debugging numerical algorithms might be a bit trickier in JS due to lack of built-in REPL analysis tools that scientists use in Python.
Official support: Currently, Enclave offers an official Python SDK, but no official TypeScript SDK (as of this writing). The Enclave team has hinted at a TypeScript SDK (they’ve asked the community for feedback about it on social media), but until it exists, using TS means you’ll be calling Enclave’s REST and WebSocket APIs “manually”. This isn’t too hard – you’d use fetch/Axios for REST and something like ws library for websockets – but it’s extra work compared to the plug-and-play Python client.
Recommendation: If you’re comfortable in TypeScript and building everything from the ground up, you can certainly proceed in TS. The core logic of a breakout strategy (tracking highs, placing orders) is not terribly heavy, and Node’s performance will handle it. Just be ready to handle things like authentication, request signing (if needed), and data handling without an off-the-shelf library. On the other hand, if you want to get to a working prototype quickly and leverage the rich analytics ecosystem, Python might be the better starting point
bigbrainmoney.com
. You could even develop the strategy in Python to validate it and then port critical pieces to Node/TS for deployment, if you prefer a TS production environment. Many algo traders do prototyping in Python and then rewrite in a faster language if needed. In your case, since even small live trading on Enclave has rewards, you might stick with Python at first to get something running (taking advantage of the Enclave SDK and finance libraries), and later build a TypeScript version once you’re confident in the strategy’s mechanics. (Either way, both languages are used in algorithmic trading – Python for its ease and community, and JavaScript/Node for certain low-latency and integration advantages. There’s no wrong choice, just a question of which trade-offs you prefer.)
Implementing the Breakout Strategy Logic
Now, let’s dive into the strategy itself – “Breakout Strategy” as you described:
“Buy on breakout above resistance (e.g., 20-day high) with volume increase; sell (or short) below support. Use a trailing stop.”
This breaks down into a few components we need to implement:
1. Identifying Key Levels (Resistance & Support)
First, your bot needs to continuously identify the price level that constitutes “resistance” and “support” for the asset. Commonly, resistance could be the highest price observed in the last N periods (bars) – for example, the past 20 days if you’re using daily data, or perhaps the past 20 hours for intraday swing trading. Likewise, support might be the lowest price in the last N periods. The choice of N (look-back window) is critical and can be tuned per market.
If Enclave offers candlestick data or you can easily fetch historical prices, you can calculate the 20-day high/low directly. If not, you’ll build it on the fly: as each new price comes in, maintain a rolling window of the max and min. A simple approach is to store recent prices in an array (or use a deque for efficiency) and update the max/min each time. If the window is large (20 days of minute-by-minute ticks is 28,800 data points), you might use a more efficient structure or periodically reset your calculation.
For intraday breakout strategies, you might use shorter windows (e.g., the high of the previous day for an opening range breakout, or the high of the last X hours). Since crypto trades 24/7, “20-day high” is a straightforward concept, but you could also consider things like weekly highs, etc., depending on how long you aim to hold positions.
Tuning per market: As you noted, each market might behave differently. BTC-USD.P might rarely make new 20-day highs (except in strong bull runs), so a 20-day breakout might be a significant event. An altcoin like AVAX-USD.P might hit 20-day highs more frequently due to higher volatility. You might choose different N for each or adjust on the fly. It’s wise to keep these as configuration parameters so you can experiment (e.g., try 10-day vs 20-day and see which yields better results).
2. Volume and Volatility Confirmation
Breakouts are notorious for false signals – price pokes above a level and then reverses. One way to filter out false breakouts is to require a confirmation by volume or volatility. The idea is that when a price truly breaks out, a lot of traders jump in (high volume) and the price move extends (increased volatility/range). A feeble break with low volume is suspect. In practical terms, your bot should monitor trading volume on Enclave (number of contracts traded) over recent intervals. For example, if typically 1000 contracts trade per hour on an asset, but in the last 5 minutes since the breakout the volume is already 500+ contracts, that’s a significant spike. You can set a threshold like “volume in the breakout minute is 2-3x the average minute volume” as a trigger condition. Enclave’s API will give you trade data (each trade has a size) or perhaps aggregate volume in each order book update. You might have to calculate it: sum the sizes of trades in the last X minutes. This is where an external data source could also help – if you have a feed that provides overall market volume for the asset across exchanges, that’s even more powerful (to see if the move is broad-based). But at minimum, use Enclave’s own volume data. Volatility filters could mean something like checking the ATR (Average True Range) or simply the magnitude of the breakout candle. For instance, you might require that the price moved at least Y% beyond the breakout level in short order to consider it a true breakout (to avoid cases where it just peeps above by $0.01 and falls back). Automation tip: You can script these calculations fairly easily. In Python, for example, you could use Pandas to maintain a rolling window of volume and price range. In Node, you’d update counters/arrays with each tick. The key is that your code should continuously update the current resistance, support, average volume, etc., and on each new price tick, check if a breakout condition is met.
3. Signal Generation (Detecting the Breakout)
With the groundwork above, generating a signal means:
Long Entry Signal: If the latest price trades above the recorded resistance level (e.g., exceeds the previous 20-day high) and your volume/volatility criteria are met, then trigger a Buy signal. This aligns with the rule “Entry Point: Buy on breakout above resistance”
forexpeacearmy.com
. In practice, you might want a tiny buffer to avoid noise – e.g., price must exceed the level by some ticks or a small percentage to confirm the break. Some strategies also wait for a candle close above the level (to avoid intra-bar fake-outs), but that introduces delay; since you’re automating, you might catch the moment it crosses and then manage the trade tightly with stops.
Short Entry Signal: Likewise, if price falls below the support level (e.g., breaks the recent low) on high volume, trigger a Sell/Short signal. (Even if you plan mostly to go long, it’s often wise to allow your strategy to short breakdowns too – many breakout traders do both sides to profit in downtrends as well.)
Avoiding whipsaws: To further guard against false signals, you could incorporate additional confirmations like checking a trend indicator (for instance, ensure a longer-term moving average is trending up when taking a breakout to the upside, etc.), or implementing a time filter (e.g., don’t trade breakouts during very off-peak hours when liquidity is low and moves are more likely false). These are optional, but worth considering if you find the raw breakout signals are too noisy.
Logging the event: When a breakout condition is triggered, log the details (price, level, volume, time) for your records. This will help you analyze later if your criteria were tight enough.
4. Executing Trades via API
Once a breakout signal is identified, the bot needs to execute the trade on Enclave quickly:
Order Type: Typically, breakout strategies use market orders to ensure you don’t miss the move. Enclave’s design aims to have no or minimal slippage (thanks to mid-point matching and deep liquidity)
team1.blog
, so a market order should get you in at a fair price without a huge penalty. Alternatively, you could place a limit order just beyond the breakout level (for example, a tick above the resistance for a buy). This might get a slightly better price if the breakout continues, but it carries the risk of not filling if the market spikes too fast. Given the goal of capturing momentum, a market order on breakout is a reasonable choice for automation, and you can factor the minor execution cost into your strategy’s performance.
Using the API: With the Enclave Python SDK, placing a market order might look like:
client.perps.add_order("BTC-USD.P", enclave.models.BUY, None, Decimal(0.1), order_type=enclave.models.MARKET)
(assuming the SDK uses None or a similar convention for price on market orders – refer to their docs for the exact usage). If you go with REST/TS, you’d call the appropriate endpoint (likely something like POST /perps/orders with JSON including symbol, side, size, etc.). Enclave will require authentication (API key/secret or perhaps a signed message if using wallet auth). The Python client handles auth under the hood; in TS you’ll handle it (probably an API key and secret that you obtain from your Enclave account dashboard – since Enclave uses Web3 login, this might involve creating an API key after login, or possibly using your wallet’s signature as auth in some way).
Order Confirmation: After sending the order, check the response to confirm it was accepted. Then monitor for execution. If using a market order, it should fill immediately. If using limit, you may need to watch the order book or wait for a fill event. The WebSocket could send an execution update or you might poll an order status endpoint. It’s important to handle cases where your order doesn’t execute (e.g., if price reverses instantly and your limit didn’t hit, you might want to cancel it after a timeout to avoid a stale order). This level of nuance is what turns a basic script into a robust bot.
Initial Stop Placement: Right after entering a trade, if possible, place a stop-loss order (or at least register a stop price in your code). Enclave supports adding a Stop-Loss (SL) to an open position
enclave.market
. You can, for example, submit a stop-market order that will trigger if price goes against you, to limit your loss. A common technique is to set the stop just below the breakout level you bought (for a long trade), because if the price falls back below that former resistance (now supposed support), the breakout likely failed. The Forex Peace Army snippet you found aligns with this: “Use stop-loss orders based on support/resistance levels.”
forexpeacearmy.com
. So if you bought the breakout of $100, and $100 was the old resistance, you might put your stop at $99 or $98 (somewhat below, accounting for noise). For a short trade from a breakdown, the stop goes just above the broken support.
Trailing Stop Logic: We’ll cover this in the next section, but note that initially the stop is static. If the trade works and price moves in your favor, you’ll later adjust it upward (for a long) to lock in profit, effectively trailing behind price.
5. Post-Trade Management (Trailing Stops and Exits)
How you manage the trade after entry determines a lot of the strategy’s performance. The brief says “Use a trailing stop”, meaning you want to let the trade run as long as it’s making new highs (for longs) but have the stop loss move up along with it to protect profits.
Trailing Stop Implementation: Since Enclave’s provided order types (as per FAQs) include normal stop-loss but not an automatic trailing-stop order, you’ll implement the trailing behavior in your code. This means your bot must keep track of the highest price since entry (for a long trade) or lowest price since entry (for a short). As the price moves, you decide when to move your stop. A typical rule: “trail by X% or $Y from the peak.” For example, you might set X = 2%. So if your long trade is up and the price hits $110 (from a $100 entry), your stop might trail at $110 - 2% ≈ $107.8. If price keeps climbing to $120, the stop ratchets up to ~$117.6. If price then reverses and hits $117.6, your stop order triggers and you exit, locking in profit. This way, you don’t exit too early – only when a reversal of ~2% happens. The specific trailing distance is another parameter to tune; too tight and you get knocked out on minor pullbacks, too loose and you give back a lot of profit. Some strategies start with a larger trailing gap that tightens as the move extends.
Coding the Trailing Stop: After entering a position, your bot’s event loop should monitor price continuously. Each time a new higher high is observed, it can adjust the stop. You’d typically cancel the old stop-loss order and place a new one at the higher level (Enclave’s API will need to allow order cancellation and new SL placement – most exchanges do). Beware of frequent cancel/replace; don’t do it on every single tick or you may hit rate limits or make a mess. A good approach is to update stops at a reasonable interval or threshold – e.g., only move the stop in increments (say every 0.5% move or every $X move). That also avoids trailing too closely.
Profit Targets vs. Trailing: You may choose not to have any fixed take-profit target and rely solely on the trailing stop to decide when to exit (this lets winners run potentially far). Alternatively, you could set a take-profit at, say, a certain multiple of your risk (e.g., 3x your stop distance) to take a sure profit, though that caps upside. Many breakout traders prefer trailing stops without a fixed target, because the biggest breakouts can be very profitable and you don’t want to cut them short. It’s up to your strategy design; you could even do a mix (e.g., sell half the position at a target, trail the rest).
Handling False Breakouts: If a breakout fails, you’ll get stopped out relatively quickly. That’s okay – small losses are part of trading. The key is that your risk per trade is controlled by that initial stop distance. If you find many breakouts are failing, you might refine your entry criteria or reduce trading during certain conditions. But some false signals are inevitable, hence the need for a strict stop-loss.
Re-entry logic: Sometimes, price may breakout, hit your stop, then later breakout again properly. You may want your bot to be ready to re-enter if the signal triggers again, as long as conditions are still favorable. Just ensure you don’t get caught in rapid whipsaws – maybe enforce a short cooldown period after a stop-out before considering a new entry, or require the price to convincingly move again.
Tuning and Monitoring the Strategy
Developing a profitable strategy is an iterative process. You’ve noted that “each market may need tuning differently or [strategies] work for periods and not for others.” This is true – markets evolve, and a strategy that worked in last month’s trending market might struggle in this month’s range-bound market. Here’s how to approach tuning and maintaining your breakout bot:
Parameter Tuning: As discussed, you have several parameters: the lookback period for high/low, the volume threshold, the trailing stop gap, etc. It’s wise to test different values. If you have historical data, perform backtests. If not (or in addition), conduct forward tests with small stakes. For example, you might run the bot on BTC-USD.P with a 20-day breakout rule and observe for a few weeks. Simultaneously, maybe run it on SOL-USD.P with a 10-day rule. Compare results. Keep notes on what seems to catch the moves versus what triggers too often or fails.
Market Differences: Larger cap coins like BTC and ETH might require more confirmation (they can have more false breakouts due to heavy algo trading around key levels), whereas smaller ones might need looser stops (because they’re more volatile by nature). Also, consider adjusting timeframe per market: maybe BTC you trade on a 1-hour candle breakout, but for SOL you could even try a 15-minute breakout if you’re more short-term – if that suits volatility. These are all hypotheses you can test.
Regime Detection: In advanced strategies, you might incorporate a volatility regime filter. For instance, measure the average true range (ATR) or an ADX (trend strength indicator). When volatility or trend strength is low, breakouts are more likely to fail (price just oscillates). You might instruct your bot to stand down during those times (no trades), or use different criteria. When volatility picks up, you deploy the breakout strategy actively. This kind of dynamic adjustment can improve performance over simply using one static rule in all conditions.
Monitoring and Visibility: It’s crucial to have visibility into what your bot is doing, especially since you’ll be letting it trade live. To achieve this:
Logging: Have your bot print/log key events: e.g., “BTC breakout detected at $42,000, volume 2x average – BUY order sent”, “Trade filled, entry=42050, stop=40700”, “Moved stop to 43000 (locking $950 profit)”, “Stopped out at 43000, P/L = +$950”. These logs not only help debug issues, but later you can analyze them to see if your logic behaved as expected.
Analytics: Save your trade data. Even just a CSV or JSON file with each trade’s details (entry time/price, exit time/price, reason for exit, etc.) will let you evaluate performance. You can compute metrics like win rate, average win vs loss, max drawdown, etc. If coding that from scratch is too much initially, at least keep the raw records so you can analyze in Excel or a notebook later.
Dashboard (optional): If you’re inclined, you could make a simple dashboard showing the current market price and your bot’s current status (position, P/L, levels). For instance, if using Python, maybe use a Jupyter notebook with live updating, or if using TS, maybe a small web page that queries your bot’s status. This isn’t strictly necessary, but visualizing the strategy (like plotting the price with your breakout levels and executed trades) can greatly aid intuition. Enclave’s interface itself has integrated TradingView charts
team1.blog
 – you might even open the web app to watch and mentally verify that your bot’s actions make sense relative to the chart.
Adapting Over Time: If you notice the strategy performs well in certain market conditions and poorly in others, consider adding those condition checks to the bot. For example, some breakout traders avoid trading during major news events (too unpredictable) or during very low liquidity hours. You can code the bot to pause trading at those times. Conversely, if volatility has been dead for days, perhaps you lower your breakout threshold (anticipating any move might be meaningful). This crosses into more complex strategy design, but it’s the kind of tuning that turns a basic strategy into a smarter one.
Testing New Strategies: You mentioned you’ll be “testing different strategies later.” A good practice is to design your bot in a modular way so that you can plugin new strategies or signals easily. For instance, you might separate the “signal generation” part from the execution part. The current strategy’s signal is “price > recent_high with vol spike”. Later you might try a mean-reversion strategy or a moving-average crossover. If your code is organized such that you can swap out or add modules, it’ll be easier to expand. This way you can run multiple strategies on different accounts or instruments and see which performs best (or even combine them).
Leveraging Enclave’s Unique Features and Incentives
Enclave Markets is a unique exchange (being a Fully Encrypted Exchange – FEX). Some of its features actually complement an automated strategy:
No Front-Running / Encrypted Order Book: Your orders and trading activity are hidden from others until execution
team1.blog
team1.blog
. This means your bot can execute breakout trades without tipping its hand (on some exchanges, a big breakout buy order might be visible and scooped by someone else; on Enclave, the matching is confidential inside the enclave). This should, in theory, give you more fair execution. It’s one less thing to worry about – you likely won’t be victim to malicious actors seeing your stops or entries in the order book, which is a plus.
Deep Liquidity and No Slippage: Enclave claims to have deep liquidity via a central limit order book and even mid-point matching for large orders
team1.blog
. So your market orders should fill at reasonable prices. Still, always check the order book or at least monitor if large market orders move the price – if Enclave’s volume is low, you don’t want to send an excessively large order. For initial testing with small amounts, this won’t be an issue.
Trading Competitions and Rewards: You noted “they have a reward scheme so I’ll test with small amounts rather than simulation since even failure will be rewarded.” This likely refers to Enclave’s trading competitions or incentive programs. Indeed, Enclave has run contests where traders earn rewards based on trading volume and participation, not just P/L
theindustryspread.com
. For example, a recent EnclaveX trading competition offered $50k in prizes, with top rewards going to the highest volume traders and even the 4th-10th place getting rewards
theindustryspread.com
. This means that by actively trading (even at small size, but frequently), you can earn a share of rewards. It’s a clever approach: it encourages you to test strategies in the real market with less fear, because some losses might be offset by the competition rewards for trading volume. Given this, your plan to start live with small funds is sound. Still treat it as real money, of course – the rewards might not cover all losses, and you want to develop a strategy that actually wins on its own. But it’s a nice cushion. Make sure you register for any ongoing competition or follow Enclave’s announcements
team1.blog
 so your trading volume counts toward it. And keep trades small while experimenting; even if you “lose” a little in strategy testing, the education and possibly the reward points gained are valuable.
Perpetuals specifics: Since you are trading perpetual futures, remember aspects like funding rates. Enclave charges funding every hour
enclave.market
. A breakout strategy usually doesn’t hold positions for very long (maybe hours to days, rarely weeks), so funding might not be a big factor, but be aware of it. If you, say, go long in a strongly uptrending market, funding might be positive (you’ll pay a fee to short traders each hour)
enclave.market
enclave.market
. It’s not usually huge, but don’t be surprised by small debits or credits in your PnL from funding. Your bot doesn’t necessarily need to do anything about it, but if you plan to hold a trade for many days, check the funding rate trend (some bots avoid holding right when very high funding is about to be charged, etc.).
Risk management beyond stops: Consider the account-level risk. If your bot had a bug or the strategy hit an extreme scenario, you don’t want it to drain your whole account. It’s wise to set a daily loss limit for the bot. E.g., “if total unrealized P/L goes below -X, stop trading for the day” to avoid a spiral. You can enforce this in code by monitoring the cumulative P/L.
Final Thoughts
Building an automated trading agent requires both a solid strategy and careful engineering. The Enclave API (with its high-performance, institutional-grade design

) is a capable tool to implement your breakout system, and you likely won’t need other APIs for execution. However, for market data enrichment, combining Enclave’s feed with one or two other price feeds can enhance your bot’s decision-making, allowing you to act faster and filter signals (as discussed with multi-feed strategies). To answer one of your core questions: Yes, the Enclave API is generally enough to get started, especially with the help of their Python SDK if you use it. You can get real-time prices, execute orders, and manage positions directly. But if you feel that you need a wider view of the market, it doesn’t hurt to pull in data from elsewhere – just ensure you don’t overwhelm yourself or your system’s complexity initially. It’s often best to get a basic version working with Enclave’s own data/feed, then layer on improvements like external feeds or additional strategy logic once the foundation is stable. Lastly, approach the project as an iterative learning process. Even a seemingly simple strategy like breakouts has many nuances in practice. Start small, review performance, and tweak parameters. Use the tools and rewards Enclave provides to your advantage, but also practice prudent risk management. Over time, you might incorporate more strategies (momentum, mean reversion, arbitrage, etc.) – perhaps even leveraging Enclave’s upcoming “Enclave Intelligence” insights or their alpha strategies as inspiration

. By building your bot with modularity, good logging, and the ability to ingest multiple data sources, you’re setting yourself up for long-term success, not just with this breakout strategy, but with future ideas as well.
